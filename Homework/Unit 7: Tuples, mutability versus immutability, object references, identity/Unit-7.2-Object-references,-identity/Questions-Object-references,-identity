# Variables can be equal but not refer to the same object:

q1_num_1 = 7
q1_num_2 = 7

# Variables can't refer to the same object and be unequal:

q2_num_1 = -3
q2_num_2 = -3
print(q2_num_1 == q2_num_2)

# If nums_1 and nums_2 refer to the same list object, and nums_1[0] is deleted, that affects nums_2 as they're the same list. With tuples, this can't occur as tuples are
# immutable.

# Rebinding a variable occurs when a new value is assigned to it:

q3_zip_code = "97331"
q3_zip_code = "98225"
print(q3_zip_code)

# q3_zip_code creates a string with the "97331" value and binds zip_code to that object. The second line creates a new string "98225", rebinding zip_code to the new object.
